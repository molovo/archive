Hi, I'm James, a designer and developer, currently working at [Superrb Studio](https://superrb.com).

I'm the creator of [Zulu](https://zulu.sh), [ZUnit](https://zunit.xyz) and [Phillip](https://philliphq.github.io), as well as [some other cool projects](/projects/). When I'm not up in the middle of the night writing code, you can find me [talking rubbish on Twitter](https://twitter.com/molovo).

If you'd like to hire me, see some of my client work, or talk about the weather, send me an email at [hi@molovo.co](mailto:hi@molovo.co). I might even reply.
