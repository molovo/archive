Giving up smoking is the hardest thing I've ever had to do.

I've spent the last 4 months, 3 weeks, 2 days and 13 hours desperate for a cigarette.

I've only relapsed once.

Well, OK, twice.

But, in less than month, I'll get to meet my daughter for the first time.

From the first second I hold her in my arms, it will all seem worthwhile.

I can't wait.
