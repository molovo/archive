  <h1 class="intro__heading">Hi, I'm James.<br />I make websites.</h1>

  <p>I'm currently leading the talented development team at <a href="https://superrb.com" target="_blank">Superrb Studio</a>.</p>

  <p>I'm the creator of <a href="https://zulu.molovo.co" target="_blank">Zulu</a>, <a href="https://zunit.xyz" target="_blank">ZUnit</a> and <a href="https://philliphq.github.io" target="_blank">Phillip</a>, as well as <a href="/projects/" target="_blank">some other cool projects</a>. When I'm not up in the middle of the night writing code, you can find me <a href="https://twitter.com/molovo" target="_blank">talking rubbish on Twitter</a>.</p>

  <p>If you'd like to hire me, see some of my client work, or talk about the weather, send me an email at <a href="mailto:hi@molovo.co" target="_blank">hi@molovo.co</a>. I might even reply.</p>
