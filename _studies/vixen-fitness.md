Gemma from Vixen Fitness came to me just as she was launching her personal training business, with only a name to get her started. Launching a brand-new business in a busy space is always a challenge, so she tasked me with coming up with a brand and website package which would help her to stand out.

Since Gemma specialises in pre- and post-natal excercise, she wanted something that was unmistakeably feminine, whilst conveying the strength and body confidence that her clients aspire to. The flowing form of the vixen&mdash;a well-known metaphor for female beauty&mdash;seemed like the perfect fit.
