      <p>Gemma is a personal trainer, specialising in pre- and post-natal fitness, and using exercise as a way to boost self-esteem and body confidence. She came to me just as she was launching her new, as-yet-unnamed business, and was looking for guidance to help her get it off the ground.</p>

      <p>Launching a brand-new business in a busy space is always a challenge, so Gemma tasked me with coming up with a name, brand and website package which would help her to stand out.</p>

      <p>Before I could do any design work, we needed to come up with a name for this new venture. When Gemma and I sat down to discuss options, it wasn't long before we had uncovered two key points which needed to be addressed:</p>

      <ol class="study__feature-list">
        <li>Since Gemmaâ€™s client base is predominantly women, we needed something that was unmistakably feminine.</li>
        <li>At the same time, it needed to convey the strength and body confidence that her clients aspire to.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>After throwing around a few abstract ideas, we both came to the same conclusion; The flowing form of the vixen&mdash;a well-known metaphor for female beauty&mdash;seemed like the perfect fit, and the name Vixen Fitness was born.</p>

      <p>For the Vixen Fitness logo, I used a simple icon of a vixen, with a long, flowing curve to symbolise its tail. Used with a bold, all-caps logotype, it really nailed the balance of strength and femininity that we were looking for.</p>

      <p>The strong, unapologetic boldness of Montserrat was so effective as a logotype that I decided to use it as the primary font for the website and Gemma's marketing materials. Using multiple weights meant we could strike a nice balance between huge, bold headings and a cleaner, lighter weight for more readable body copy.</p>

      <p>To counter Montserrat's strength I used Have Heart One to add a touch of femininity to headings and other brand assets.</p>

      <p>Gemma meets most of her clients face to face, but handing over a business card doesn't really convey everything that she has to offer. To help her make a good impression, I designed a series of postcards to give to clients and hand out at events; each one providing more information about particular services she provides, allowing her to put the right information in front of prospective clients from the outset, and hopefully win their business.</p>
