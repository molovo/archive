My life is full of lists. I have a list of emails I haven't yet replied to. A list of chores my girlfriend has given me pinned to the fridge. A list of invoices that are as yet unpaid. A list of things my daughter wants for christmas. A list of issues for each of the list of projects I'm working on for each of my list of clients.

I hate lists. I'd never write one out of choice, yet they seem to be everywhere. As the defacto standard for displaying more than one item of information, lists are *shit*. Lists convey quantity; they create indecision; they promote procrastination.
