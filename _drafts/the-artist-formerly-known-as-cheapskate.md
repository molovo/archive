There's a common belief out there that designers are snobs. I should know; *I think I'm one of them now*.

I never used to be a snob. I used to laugh at *those people*, swimming in a sea of Apple products, gourmet coffee and handmade rucksacks. I used to download films illegally. I used to only use free apps. I used to collect crap, buying the cheapest of whatever I needed, and keeping it when it inevitably broke, just in case.

But the more I understand about design, the more I've come to appreciate it. I've come to appreciate the extra care and attention that goes into a fantastically well designed product. I love the ease of use of my Apple TV, and I'm willing to pay for Netflix to use on it. I'm willing to pay to stream music through Rdio. I've replaced a full set of kitchen knives with one or two premium products that cover all bases, and do it well. I've traded instant coffee for an espresso machine. I've stopped chaining three cheap routers in an attempt to get a wireless network to cover my house, and replaced them all with one Time Capsule. I spent $15 on an email app for my phone.

Moving house two weeks ago, I finally had an opportunity to filter out the crap. I've made multiple tip runs, and donated boxes and boxes of things to charity.

And it's not like I'm spending a fortune to live this way. Although the initial outlay might be higher, these quality products last longer. They suit my needs better.
