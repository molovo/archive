<p>Melody was borne out of frustration with the available CSS frameworks at the time. I was jumping between frameworks the second a new one came out. Why? Because the ones I was using didnâ€™t really meet my needs, they all involved compromises. I needed something incredibly easy to use; flexible enough to encourage rapid prototyping, yet robust enough to use as production code.</p>

<p>When I first built Melody in 2012, it was one of the first frameworks to drop support for IE7 and below, and use <code>display: inline-block;</code> for arranging grid elements, rather than floating them. It used padding and <code>box-sizing: border-box;</code> instead of margin for gutters, to allow grids to be nested. The whole CSS file was just 8kb, yet still managed to include a reset, the typographic foundation, and a full CSS grid system.</p>

<p>It became the foundation of all my client development work for the next two years, as well as being used by developers all over the world. Here&rsquo;s the site as it was when Melody was released:</p>

<p><figure>
  <div class="browser">
    <img src="/assets/dist/img/melody-old-homepage.jpg" alt="The old Melody homepage">
  </div>
  <div class="image-caption">
    <span>The old Melody homepage</span>
  </div>
</figure></p>

<p>As time went on, my skills and experience broadened, and I began experimenting with SASS and Gulp. For a time, I used the original melody.css as a base stylesheet, and used SASS to build site-specific styles on top of this. However I soon grew tired of the disconnect, and decided to rebuild Melody from the ground up; less as a grid system, but as a full SASS layout engine, keeping true to the principles on which I built the original.</p>

<p>One thing that I did want to improve on, was that the original Melody was heavily dependent on classes in the markup. In this new version, I wanted to go one step further, and do as much of the layout work autonomously as possible, without dirtying my markup. The new <a href="//melody.molovo.co/layouts">layout functions</a> require only a single SASS mixin to be applied to the parent, allowing the framework to do the rest for you.</p>

<p>With the increased flexibility of this new version, there is of course more complications, and so I have also developed a new site, containing in-depth documentation of all of Melody&rsquo;s features.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m using an early version of this new framework on this site, and I&rsquo;m continuing to develop it as I use it on both personal and client projects.</p>

<p><small>NOTE: I wrote in more depth about my reasons for building the framework in an article on <a href="http://everydaydesigner.net/development/i-build-my-own-tools-and-you-should-too">Everyday Designer</a>.</small></p>
