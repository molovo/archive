      <blockquote><p>Like a car crash or your first hangover, crowdsourcing is a mistake every designer should make, and most likely will make at least once.</p></blockquote>

<p>A bold claim, but I&rsquo;ll stand by it. I abhor crowdsourcing, and wouldn&rsquo;t wish it on anyone, but having said that, if you do get sucked in what&rsquo;s important is what you learn from the experience, and how it improves your work, your approach to design, and your valuation of your own work.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been meaning to write this article for a while, and have decided to revisit it to add some additional thoughts after becoming involved in a heated discussion on Twitter about the ethics of crowdsourcing, in which, I&rsquo;ll admit, I was a little unnecessarily sarcastic.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been sucked into the crowdsourcing spiral before. Every freelancer will experience a lull in work at one time or another, and as a young designer, having never heard of crowdsourcing, when I first became aware of it I initially saw it as a way to make a quick buck between projects. How wrong I was.</p>

<p>My crowdsourcing adventure lasted six weeks. In that time I devoted 97 hours to a total of 43 contests. I tried to be sensible, and only pitched for logo and branding projects, knowing that entering into a full web design contest was likely to take up too much of my time. I religiously stuck to each client brief; sketched, planned and developed good designs, designs that I would have been more than happy to present to a real, paying client. In fact, a couple of them made their way into my portfolio, so pleased I was with the quality of my work.</p>

<p>I earnt a grand total of £0.00. Zilch. Nada. Nothing.</p>

<p>The same number of hours spent on actual client work would have earnt me enough to buy a car.</p>

<p>However, in some ways the process was beneficial. It provided experience, which as a young designer is invaluable. It afforded me the opportunity to explore new techniques. Most importantly, it taught me that <em>my time is the most valuable asset I have as a designer</em>. Crowdsourcing wastes it. I still occasionally do free work when I&rsquo;m not busy, but I instead do valuable work which, rather than being lost in a sea of contest entries, will be used, and may provide me with additional exposure. Work for a charity; testing and development of open source software; a plugin or two.</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/sam_piggott">Sam Piggott</a> summed up his experiences for me:</p>

<blockquote><p>You&rsquo;ll spend hours designing or developing a proposal with the mindset that there&rsquo;s no WAY the client will turn it down - only to find that someone has copied you and is charging half the price for a half-assed job. Crowdsourcing is not worth your time. Your time is better spent going out into the world and knocking on doors - that&rsquo;s far more beneficial and gets your face known. - <a href="http://twitter.com/sam_piggott">@Sam_Piggott</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Brilliant advice that has been echoed in all corners of the design community.</p>

<p>Now, finally, onto the point of this post. Imagine my surprise to find that the well-known <a href="http://stokefire.com">Stokefire Branding</a> have recently been using crowdsourcing for their projects. This is a high class agency, active in the design community, and who put out extremely high quality work of their own accord. Yet their recent announcement on twitter of a project hosted on crowdSPRING caused a bit of a storm:</p>

<blockquote><p>Personally, I see it as totally unethical and find it odd that an established agency would turn to it&hellip; when spec work is usually so frowned upon by respected designers. - <a href="http://twitter.com/illogicaljake">@illogicaljake</a></p>

<p>What would you call the 100s of unchosen entries? I would call that getting something for nothing. - ‏<a href="http://twitter.com/BenBloodworth">@BenBloodworth</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Stokefire have promised a blog post on the subject, but whilst we wait for that, they have said that they will give $20 &ldquo;to any designer whose work we reference as an example - good or bad&rdquo;. I can understand the sentiment behind this, but believe they are misguided in their intentions. Given the number of entries usually made to these contests, $20 a pop would likely add up to a considerable expense, not including the time that would be spent reviewing and responding to each entry.</p>

<p>Rather than <em>encouraging</em> the crowdsourcing industry, there are much better ways that this money could be invested in order to spur on budding designers. Inviting local students into the office for a days work experience perhaps? I know of many people who would give an arm for such an opportunity. Maybe putting on a series of talks or webinars about the design processes they follow - I&rsquo;d watch those myself.</p>

<p>They also show a little naivety not to see the fact that, whilst better than the zero return usually on offer, $20 seriously undervalues the time and effort that will be put into these entries.</p>

<p>I may have learnt from my experiences and moved on, but there are many young designers out there who attempt to make a living solely from crowdsourcing. I really feel for these people, and Stokefire owes it to them to join forces with the rest of the community to stamp out crowdsourcing, and to educate young designers about why they should avoid it. With the backing of a company of their stature we may just see progress, but with their current attitude they are merely providing <a href="https://twitter.com/rosskimbarovsky/status/273914792304078849"> propaganda</a> for those who make a living preying on the weak and inexperienced.</p>
