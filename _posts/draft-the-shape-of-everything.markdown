  Everything has a shape. Curved lines, straight lines, rounded corners, sharp corners, surfaces, holes, dents and ridges. These are the things that allow us to recognise an object.

  Over time, our ability to create these shapes has developed exponentially. We now have materials that allow us to build things smaller, lighter and stronger than ever before, but the way in which we represent these objects has hardly changed at all.

    Part One: <strong>Doors</strong>

Take the humble door. For two thousand years, doors have been around six feet tall, three feet wide, with four sides, and a handle on one side, at roughly hand height.

There are occasional variations on this theme, but for the most part, they are simple, functional, rectangular planks of wood.

To compensate for this uniformity, we use colours, panels in the wood, plate glass and ornaments to distinguish one door from another; to mask its appearance with a facade of uniqueness.

Then we experiment with the handles. Rather than just a single lever to release the catch, we remove the catch altogether, with a "pull handle" on one side, and a plate for pushing on the other.

So now we have a set of brightly coloured, attention seeking doors, all following a set of universal conventions.

But, even though these conventions are ingrained in our consciousness, there is still a cognitive load associated with the door. A lever-handled door without a window of any kind gives no indication of whether it should be pushed or pulled. We have to deduce this, either through examining the door frame, or through trial and error. Before we can do even that, we first need to find the handle itself.

Similiarly, with a door marked Push/Pull, we have to read the label to know which to do, or we'd need to go through trial and error again.








<!-- The quality of the paper we print images on has improved, yet the images we place on them haven't. Yes we have increased the resolution, but images are still fundamentally a 2D representation of a 3D object, and can never recreate the image seen by the naked eye.

We suffer from the same limitations when viewing images on the screen. 3D glasses aren't the first attempt at creating a true 3D image, but they are beginning to be widely adopted. Unfortunately here, the physiological downsides (headaches etc.) reduce their effectiveness. -->
