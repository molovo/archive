Those of you who know me well, have probably noticed that I always have an ugly, brown bag across my shoulder. I've lived out of that bag for about eight years. If I ever lost it I'd be royally fucked.

Everything I need, both for my job and my personal life, live in that bag. None of the things hold any sentimental value, they are just things that I feel I need on me at all times for my job. It travels with me to clients' offices, friends' and relatives' houses, conferences, bars; even my morning trip out for breakfast.

At the time of writing the contents are as follows:

* 1 MacBook Pro - 99% of my work is done on this
* Various tablets:
	* 1 iPad Air
	* 1 iPad Mini
	* 1 Surface 2
	* 1 Nexus 7
* 1 backup phone (a Nokia Lumia 520 - just in case)
* Chargers to support all of the above
	* 1 MacBook Pro Charger
	* 1 Lightning Cable
	* 1 MicroUSB Cable
* 1 Adonit Jot Pro stylus
* Various papers relating to client work
* 1 dot grid notebook containing detailed sketches of two or three promising app ideas
* Various hotel Invoices
* 1 european power adapter
* 1 purple Vans hoodie
* 1 contact lens case and solutions
* 1 pair of glasses
* 1 can of Red Bull (for emergencies only)
* 2 spare packs of cigarette papers
* 1 spare pack of tobacco
* 2 spare lighters
* 3 pencils, 1 pen
* 1 pair WESC RAZR headphones
* 1 spare pair of cheap Samsung headphones

As well as all the above, I'll ocassionally stuff in some spare clothes if I crash at a friends house, shopping (on the rare occasion I do any), my Wacom tablet, and an Apple wireless keyboard to use with the iPads. Plus, I'd like to fit my camera and possibly a couple of lenses in there too now I've finally gotten around to buying one.

The bag itself isn't anything special, just an old, brown Animal messenger bag that I don't even remember buying. Years ago, I needed a bag for something, and found it in my old wardrobe in my parent's house and just dumped everything in it.

The problem with something this simple is you don't realise how much you rely on it until you don't have it any more. **My bag is dying**. Two of the three clasps have fallen off, the zip on the front pocket doesn't close all the way, and the strap is frayed almost to breaking point.

So today I bought a new bag. The only reason I hadn't replaced it until now, is that having realised just how important this bit of kit is to me, I wanted to put some research in and make sure I could get something that meets my needs, and will last as long as the old one. Traditional laptop bags are far too rigid - I can't just keep stuffing things in - and normal messenger bags just aren't sturdy enough for that amount of weight.

I wanted the best bag that money could buy. I looked at low-end, high-end, even custom-made solutions. I found some really inventive bags aimed at designers, with pockets for a laptop, graphics tablet, notebooks and an iPad, which look great, but there's no room in there for anything else. I looked at backpacks but they feel too restrictive on my shoulders.

Knowing this new bag would have to have quite a bit more room than the old one, and be structurally strong enough to protect the camera and its accessories, I stopped looking at laptop bags, and started looking at camera bags.

And that's when I found the [Domke F-833](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B003JME5PM/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). I'm not usually one to spend the price of a weekend away on something as simple as a bag, but it had everything I wanted, should be rugged enough to handle being dragged around every day, and still looks cool to boot.

Hopefully with my new bag I'll have as much of a fulfilling relationship as I did with my old one. I'm still trying to think of a way to give the old one the retirement it deserves; I'm open to ideas.
