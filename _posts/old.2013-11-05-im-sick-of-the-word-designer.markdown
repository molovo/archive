> I'm a **Designer**

Notice the emphasis. There's always emphasis. The above sentence appears on the websites and blogs of a million twenty-something, naive little twats the world over, jobless and fresh out of university, describing what they do in such a vague way because they're *so fucking cool*.

You'll recognise them as the people who recite [Dieter Rams 10 Design Priniciples](https://readymag.com/u15041256/32/) like some horrible bastard lovechild of the Dribbble comments section and the Westboro Baptist Church.

It's because of these dicks - these people who don't realise that design has been around for thousands of years, not just since the advent of the web - that terms like "Unicorn" and "Rainbow" designers are now flying around the internet. These Photoshop Jockeys immediately discount anyone who can write the smallest amount of HTML as not being a "proper" designer, just because they're too fucking lazy to learn to code themselves.

Design is solving problems. It's about being given a brief for a thing, finding the best way to create/fix/present the thing, and fucking doing it.

Development *is design*. Typesetting *is design*. Carpentry *is design*. Aircraft Engineering *is design*. Fucking sewer system architecture *is design*.

Just because someone can write a bit of code, doesn't mean they're a bad designer. And if you can't write code, that doesn't either. The only things that make someone a bad designer, are being a fucking bad designer, or having your head so far up your own ass that you can chew on your tonsils.
