Throughout my life, I've constantly found myself amazed at how little I know. My ability to learn has always been fuelled by this feeling of inadequacy, and a desire to better myself. It's the thing that keeps me going at 4.30am, trying to meet a deadline, with absolutely no idea of how I'm going to get there.

Socrates once said *"The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing."*, and I take solace in the fact that I'm never going to "know it all". The world would be an incredibly boring place if I had no capacity for learning.

And similiarly, who is to say that society's definition of intelligence is the most valid? Someone with a high IQ may be intelligent in a academic sense, but conversely may struggle in social situations. Professional athletes attract a stereotype of low intelligence, yet they have a knowledge and understanding of their own sport far beyond that of the average person.

I struggled at school. Maths and English and science were never that attractive to me, and so I struggled. I left school without a-levels, and as such, society would deem me unintelligent. Yet in the field of design, given a medium in which I can produce tangible results, and inspire emotions, I am holding my own.

I am no longer the sum of my grades, I am a person; judged by the things I am good at, and not the things society tells me I should be good at. I no longer need a high aptitude in maths, as I can write functions and use tools to do the calculations for me.
