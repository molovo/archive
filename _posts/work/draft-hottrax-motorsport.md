    The colors needed to be bright and attention-seeking, so we chose a palette that followed the progression of 'shades' found in the different varieties of real ale:

    <strong><span style="color: #F87D00; text-shadow: -1px 0 black, 1px 0 black, 0 -1px black, 0 1px black;">Pale</span> &rarr; <span style="color: #152D2C;">Golden</span> &rarr; <span style="color: #F2F2F2;">Amber</span> &rarr; <span style="color: #FFFFFF;">Stout</span></strong>.

    The typography on the Haresfoot site was modelled on classic beer labels, and their ability to 'jump out' in a crowded pub.

    We loved the huge character of Langdon for headings to get the important points across, and this contrasted nicely with the fidelity of Mission Gothic for easy to read body copy.

      When you're working on a site that makes you crave a nice cold beer, you know you're building something that's going to appeal to the target market in just the way it needs to. If that's the sort of emotion that the site strikes in Haresfoot's customers, it's sure to be a success.

Real Ale has never been so popular. There are more than 700 real ale brewers in the UK -- the highest number since the Second World War, and four times as many since the founding of Camra (the **Cam**paign for **R**eal **A**le). [Haresfoot Craft Beer](http://haresfoot.com) are a new microbrewery based in Berkhamsted, started by eight friends with a real passion for their craft.

Teaming up again with Chris Page from [Tait Design](http://taitdesign.co.uk), right from the off we knew that this site needed to get taste buds tingling and mouths salivating. Chris had already come up with a series of beer labels, making great use of bold, bright colours to entice beer-lovers. We built on these when forming ideas for the site itself, keeping the bold colours and beautiful patterns for a really eye-catching experience.

The first step was to create a landing page, as a way to build interest in the Haresfoot brand prior to their official launch. We knew we wanted the final site to be as simple and informative as possible, so built the holding page as a template which we could later expand on when building the final site.
