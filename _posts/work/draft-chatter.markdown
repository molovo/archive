brief: |
  With this being a Jekyll site, I needed a way of displaying comments without a database. Solutions for this already existed, but didn't blend in with a site's design as well as I'd hoped, so I decided to build my own.

  I wanted to build something that blended seamlessly with any website, was easy to use, setup and maintain, and most of all, had no advertising.
solution: |
  Chatter took influence from
color-palette: ["#FFFFF8", "#CBD09E", "#444444", "#FFFFFF"]
typography:
  style: "background: #FFFFF8;"
  heading:
    name: Omnes Pro
    class: tk-omnes-pro
    style: "font-weight: 300; color: white;"
  body:
    name: FF Tisa Web Pro
    class: tk-ff-tisa-web-pro
    style: "color: #444444;"
